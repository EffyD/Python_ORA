What is a programming language?
Set of conventions for authoring computer programs
What's a program?
A set of instructions for how a computer should react to various inputs and outputs


### History Lesson:
*   Punch cards
*   Assembly language
  +   Processor specific --> not portable
  +   Binary correspondence
  +  Easier to read than punch cards or binary
*   "Higher level" languages
  *   Fortran, Cobol:
    *   Easier to read and write
    *   Slightly more portable

###   Types of languages

*  Compiled Languages:
  -  C, C++, C#, Objective-C
*  Scripting languages:
  - Python, Ruby, Javascript, Lua


### Programming Language Styles

*   Procedural
*   Object Oriented


### Procedural Languages

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming,based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.

*   Procedures/Routines/Subroutines/Functions that include series of functions



### Object Oriented Languages
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self").

• represent objects
• define their properties
• define ways to manipulate them
• object inheritance
