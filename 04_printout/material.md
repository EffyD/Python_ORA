# Python Printout
The printout in python3 can e done with a print() function, with keyword arguments to replace most of the special syntax of the old print statement.

The print statement can be used in the following ways :
```python3
    print("Good Morning")
    print("Good", <Variable Containing the String>)
    print("Good" + <Variable Containing the String>)
    print("Good %s" % <variable containing the string>)
```
In Python, __single, double and triple__ quotes are used to denote a string. Most use single quotes when declaring a single character. Double quotes when declaring a line and triple quotes when declaring a paragraph/multiple lines.
