# Python Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of program statements. In Python, and in most of programming languages, there are two main types of loops: for loop and while loops.


## For loop

In Python for loop is used to iterate over the items of any sequence including the Python list, string, tuple etc. The for loop is also used to access elements from a container (for example list, string, tuple) using built-in function range().
