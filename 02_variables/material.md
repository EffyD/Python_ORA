# Python Variables

### Creating Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
```python3
x = 7
y = "Alex "
print(x)
print(y)
```
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.

```python3
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "rhcp" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
```python3
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'
```

### Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
*   A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
*   A variable name cannot start with a number
*   A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
*   Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

**Remember that variable names are case-sensitive**
