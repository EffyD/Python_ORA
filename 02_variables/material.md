# Python Variables

### Creating Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
```python3
x = 7
y = "Alex "
print(x)
print(y)
```
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.

```python3
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "rhcp" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
```python3
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'
```
