# Python Syntax

Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line: [img]

Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line: [img]


### Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
```python3
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")      #<-- 4 space indentation
```
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

```python3
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")  #<-- NO INDENTATION
```


### Python Variables

In Python variables are created the moment you assign a value to it:
```python3
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!
````
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


### Comments

Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
```python3
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
```
