### Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
```python3
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")      #<-- 4 space indentation
```
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

```python3
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")  #<-- NO INDENTATION
```
