The command:
```py
from random import randint
```
Adds to the program the randint function that returns a random number in the range. For example, we will print an entire random number from 1 to 10 on the screen:
```py
from random import randint
print (randint (1, 10))
```
Use this command and other commands you have learned to solve the following exercises:

1. Write a program that receives 10 numbers from the user and prints the largest.
2. Write a program that asks the user to enter their age and reprints the age in months. If the user entered an age other than a number, an error message should be displayed and requested again.
3. Write a program that reads rows from the user until the user enters a blank line. After inserting a blank line, all the lines he wrote from end to end must be printed back to the user.
4. Write the whole-lot scouring program from 1 to 1,000,000 until you find a number that divides by 7, 13 and 15 as well.
5. Write a program that draws two numbers from 1 to 10 and calculates their smallest common multiple, that is, the smallest number that divides the two numbers. For example, if you have rolled numbers 4 and 6, number 12 must be reprinted.
6. Write a program that randomly selects a number from 1 to 100. The user must guess the selected number and after each guess, type "too large" or "too small" according to the ratio of the selected number to the guess. Bonus: To make it interesting, make sure the program prints the wrong message from time to time.
